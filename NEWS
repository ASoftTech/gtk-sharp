Gtk# 2.99.0 - 2012-10-23
===============================================================================

Gtk# 2.99.0 is the first release of C# bindings for GTK 3.x. This is a beta
release, primarily intended for applications developers who want to start
porting their application to GTK 3.x.

This version of Gtk# provides bindings for the API exposed by these libraries:
  * cairo 1.10.0
  * glib 2.28.0
  * pango 1.28.3
  * atk 1.32.0
  * gdk-pixbuf 2.22.1
  * gtk+ 3.0.0

There is no API stability guarantee for now, but we will try to keep breaking
changes to a minimum.

This version of Gtk# can be installed in parallel with Gtk# 2.x, and should not
have any impact on applications using Gtk# 2.x.

Changes
-------

  * All the new APIs provided by GTK 3.0 and friends are now available.

  * Gtk# now provides bindings for cairo 1.10 in cairo-sharp.dll. In the future
    we might go back to using the Mono.Cairo.dll binding included in Mono.

  * Bindings for Gio are now included, instead of requiring a separate
    gio-sharp package.

  * GLib.Object now uses the Dispose pattern. Subclasses that need to do
    resource clean-up should implement a Dispose(bool) method.

  * Custom code is now provided solely using partial classes. The Foo.custom
    files that were used before are now proper Foo.cs files.

  * Various enhancements to the parser and the generator.

Bug fixes
---------

  * generator: Properly handle boolean attributes when parsing the GAPI XML
  * glib: do not call g_thread_ functions in GLib >= 2.31
  * gtk: Fix resurrection cycles in container subclasses (bxc#3801)

Lots of other bug fixes are included, in particular all the relevant fixes from
the stable 2.12 branch.
